					<h2>About <span>Myself</span></h2>
					
					<p>
					My name is Manoj Kumar. I belong to Patna (Bihar).  I pursuing MCA from Amity University Patna. My father's name is Anand Kumar and he is a businessman. I contribute my time and effort to my father's business part-time for ten years.  My mother's name is Kiran Devi, She is a housewife. 
						In 2019, I receive my BCA degree from St. Xavier College Management and Technology Patna. During my BCA, I participate in various college activities that belong to cultural programs and social welfare. Apart from these activities, I become a student cabinet council member that was elected by the principal office in 3ed year of my graduation.
						I try to be myself, be passionate about my dreams and hobbies, live honestly, and work hard to achieve all that I want to make. 
						Sometimes I like to read books, listen to and sing songs. I try to get connected with daily world current affairs news in political fields.
						My strength is to make good decisions in sensitive and harsh situations with cool and calmness. My weakness is that I trust people very easily and take risks. I have a good Resilience power as I have faced bad situations many times in my life, especially in the time of covid when my father get affected and I was stuck in hard circumstances where I manage my father's business in a good manner and I also take care his health or fulfill medical needs with my family motivation. At that time I try to lead my family in a good manner.
						My Ideal is Swami Vivekananda who drag attention to the world at the time of colonial rule about spirituality, tolerance, Hinduism, and religion in the world religion parliamentary in Chicago. I have moral values like I respect each and every person and also try to help each and every human being and animals also when they are in trouble and need help and treat each and every person equally without discriminating against them on the basis of caste, color, creed, etc. Ethics and values are very important in my life because Ethics & values make an individual aware that their choices have consequences, both for themselves and others. Thus, ethics & values build credibility, Leadership skills, improve decision-making, and provide long-term gains. 

						
						Thanks
						Manoj Kumar
